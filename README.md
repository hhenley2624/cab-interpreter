# CABInterpreter - A Custom Language Interpreter for Health Metrics and Console Interactions

>In this project, I developed a custom language interpreter named CABInterpreter. The interpreter is designed to parse and execute scripts written in a custom language, with a focus on health metrics calculations. The language supports a variety of operations such as variable declaration, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, function definitions, console interactions, and loop structures.
>
## Key Components and Techniques:

### Arithmetic Operations:

- The language supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  
- These operations can be used in expressions to calculate complex health metrics.

### Conditional Statements:

- The language supports conditional statements using the `if` and `else` keywords.
- 
- These statements allow for different calculations based on the value of certain variables, such as sex in the provided example.

### Function Definitions:

- Functions can be defined using the `clang` keyword, followed by a list of parameters.

- The `end` keyword is used to mark the end of a function.

### Function Invocation and Return:

- Functions can be invoked using the `sendit` keyword, which prints a message to the console.

- The `bang` keyword is used to return a value from a function.
  
### Loop Structures:

- The language supports `for` and `while` loops.

- These loops can be used to perform repeated operations.

### Results:

- The CABInterpreter is capable of interpreting and executing scripts written in the custom language.

- It supports a variety of programming constructs, including variable declaration, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, function definitions, console interactions, and loop structures.

- The interpreter can be used to calculate complex health metrics based on user-defined parameters.
  
### Skills Demonstrated:

- Developed and implemented a custom language interpreter, CABInterpreter, showcasing proficiency in Python programming, language design, and handling of complex programming constructs.

- Conducted comprehensive parsing of scripts written in the custom language, including variable declaration, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, function definitions, console interactions, and loop structures. This demonstrates expertise in handling diverse programming constructs and optimizing them for execution.

- Utilized Python's built-in data structures and control flow mechanisms to interpret the custom language, generating the expected output for each script. Demonstrated a strong understanding of Python programming and language interpretation.

- Implemented modular and robust code structures, incorporating error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth execution even in the presence of potential issues such as syntax errors or undefined variables. This showcases an emphasis on code reliability and maintainability.

- Developed support for console interactions using the `sendit` keyword for printing to the console and the `bang` keyword for returning values from functions. This demonstrates an understanding of function invocation and return mechanisms.

- Implemented support for loop structures, allowing for repeated operations and showcasing proficiency in handling complex programming constructs.
